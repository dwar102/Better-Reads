#Better Reads
### 12-30-2020

## Project Description

Better Reads is a dynamic web application for readers to search for and review books, as well as interact with other users.
Any visitor to the site can search for books by a range of criteria, and registered users can keep track of books they have read via their personal shelves.
User-generated tags allow readers to describe and search for books with great specificity, from identifying niche subgenres to broad, genre-spanning themes.
